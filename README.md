# Unexpected Behavior when Fetching Data in Next.js

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when fetching data in Next.js applications. The application renders successfully, but the fetched data does not appear as expected. This issue often stems from problems with asynchronous operations, data handling, or missing error handling.

## Problem

The `MyComponent` fetches data from the `/api/data` route using `fetch`. However, the fetched data is not always displayed correctly, leading to an unexpected rendering behavior.

## Solution

The solution addresses the problem by implementing robust error handling and using techniques to ensure data is properly fetched and displayed.
